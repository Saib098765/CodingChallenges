Health services must balance patient care with information privacy,access
and completeness.The massive scale of healthcare industry also amplifies
the importance of cost control.The promise of blockchain technology
in health services combined with application layers built atop
it,is to be a mechanism that provides utmost privacy. Electronic medical
records (EMRs) are electronically-stored highly sensitive and private
information related to the diagnosis and treatment of patients, and
need to be frequently shared among peers. Sharing of medical records
between participants is very challenging because the data might be revealed
or tampered during the operational process. To address these
challenges, a blockchain-based electronic medical records system is
the key solution. In this project, we have discussed how blockchain
technology can help in better healthcare data management.

We have proposed a blockchain-based records management system for efficient
online storage, retrieval and authentication of healthcare documents to support women in healthcare.
This system ensures privacy, security and easy accessibility and availability of medical records and a sustainable smart hopsital construction layout for supporting women who wish to start out as healtchcare professionals.
